# Skills

Skills are structured prompts that provide domain-specific knowledge to AI coding assistants like Claude Code and Pi. They're loaded automatically when the skill name is mentioned or when the context matches.

    └── private/         # From luanzeba/private-dotfiles repo
```

## How It Works

The `install` script:
1. Clones [badlogic/pi-skills](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills) and links the `gccli` skill on local machines (skipped in Codespaces)
2. Clones private skills from a private repo (if accessible)
3. Symlinks all skills to global locations:
   - `~/.claude/skills/<name>` (Claude Code)
   - `~/.pi/agent/skills/<name>` (Pi)

Note: `skill-creator` was originally from [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) but is now maintained locally with dotfiles-specific additions.

## Adding a New Skill

### Option 1: Add to this repo

Create a new directory under `skills/`:

```
skills/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Required: frontmatter (name, description) + instructions
└── references/        # Optional: supporting docs
```

No `skills/install` change is needed for local skills. `configure()` auto-symlinks all top-level directories under `skills/` (except `external/`).

### Option 2: Add to private repo

Add the skill to `luanzeba/private-dotfiles` under `skills/`. It will be automatically symlinked on next install.

## Skill Format

A minimal `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: When to use this skill (shown in skill picker)
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the AI...
```

See the `dotfiles/` skill for a full example with references.

## Running Install

```bash
# Via dotfiles CLI
dotfiles install skills

# Or directly
~/dotfiles/skills/install
```

`gccli` from badlogic/pi-skills is intentionally linked only on local machines (macOS/Arch), not in Codespaces.
